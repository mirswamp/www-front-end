This is a generator for "packets" for heartbit, the redacted openssl
heartbeat demonstrator.

The code here is a more full version of that in the redacted openssl
code.   Basically the additions here are a plug-in interface that allows
an actual openssl heartbeat packet to be generated using the exact
openssl code which does so:

	tls1_heartbeat()

The minimal interfaces, buffering and output structure of openssl
is duplicated to allow use of that function in-situ.

There is a custom function

	tls1_heartbleed()

which allows generation of "heartbleed" packets with arbitrary length
requests in them, subject to the 16 bit packet limitations.


This is the exact tool used to generate the valid heartbeat and
invalid "heartbleed" packets that are used to demonstrate the heartbleeds
in the redacted ssl heartbit commands.

You can regenerate the packets using the tool and use the 'diff' target
in the Makefile to see if they compare to prior versions.
