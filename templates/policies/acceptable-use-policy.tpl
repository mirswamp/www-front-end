<p>Before you can register to use the application, you must first agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>

<h2>1.0 Overview</h2>
The Acceptable Use Policy describes the responsibilities of users who maintain an account.
<h3>1.1 Objectives/Scope of this Policy</h3>
The objective of this policy is to:

<ul>
	<li>state the users’ rights and responsibilities.</li>
	<li>state if users are allowed to share accounts or if users are allowed to have multiple accounts on a single host.</li>
	<li>state password construction and aging rules.</li>
	<li>state the penalties for not following the specified guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.0 User Responsibility</h2>
<p>The service provider(s) have legal and other obligations to protect shared resources as well as the intellectual property of users. Users share this responsibility by observing the rules of acceptable use that are outlined in this document. Resources include hardware, software, network connections, and storage. Each resource is finite and shared by the entire user community. Responsible conduct on the part of each user is essential to ensure equitable and secure access for all. Failure to use resources properly may result in the penalties outlined in section 2.7, including those imposed by civil, and/or criminal penalties.</p>

<h3>2.1 Account, Password, and Key Management</h3>
<p>We will provide you with the accounts necessary to access allocated systems. An account is assigned for one user only and must not be shared with others - including students and/or collaborators.</p>

<p>To create a user account, you will be required to supply a valid email address or login using one of the supported third party login providers (e.g. GitHub, Google, or CILogon affiliated institutions). We block users from using a number of email address domains that do not give us suitable indication of a valid email address.</p>

<p>As a Project Owner, you are responsible for your Project(s) and the activities that occur within your Project(s). Your responsibilities include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Maintaining an accurate Description of your Project in your Project Profile.</li>
	<li>Inviting only known colleagues to be Project Members and promptly removing Project Members who are no longer active colleagues.</li>
	<li>Periodically reviewing Run Requests submitted by Project Members for appropriate use of resources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Passwords and keys secure access to your account. Never share a password out loud or write it down where it could be found and/or associated with your account. Never use tools that openly expose passwords on the network, such as telnet. Make sure that file and directory permissions prevent others from reading or copying SSH private keys, which are the equivalent of passwords. Do not store your password(s) in unencrypted files or even in encrypted files if possible. Password managers such as <a href="http://www.keepassx.org" target="_blank">KeePassX</a>, <a href="https://lastpass.com" target="_blank">LastPass</a>, and <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" target="_blank">1Password</a> can help you create and manage your passwords.</p>

<p>Support staff will never ask for your password, and will never send a password via e-mail or perform any other activity that could reveal it to others. If you believe that a support person is insisting that you share your password, report it to <code><a href="mailto:support@continuousassurance.org">support@continuousassurance.org</a></code>.</p>

<h3>2.2 Create Effective Passwords-Change Them Periodically</h3>
<p>Create passwords that are difficult to guess and that cannot be found in a dictionary. Birthdays, family names, and single words are examples of easily guessed passwords. Change your password periodically, even if you have no reason to believe that anyone else has it.</p>

<p>Never share your password with another user or make your password known to anyone else.</p> 

<h3>2.3 Account Compromise or Suspicious Activity</h3>
<p>We provide tools that may help protect accounts from unauthorized use; however, it is your responsibility to use these tools properly and you have ultimate responsibility to prevent unauthorized use. If you believe your account has been compromised or if you find signs of suspicious activity, take the following actions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Notify us immediately at <code><a href="mailto:support@continuousassurance.org">support@continuousassurance.org</a></code></li>
	<li>Do not modify records found in your account</li>
	<li>Do not execute unknown programs you might find</il>
	<li>If possible, do not use your account until the issue is resolved</li>
</ul>

Some indications that a compromise has occurred include:
<ul>
	<li>Records in your project areas which you did not create</li>
	<li>Unexplained alteration or deletion of your files</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4 Unauthorized Use and Access</h3>
<p>How you intend to use resources must be clearly defined in your permission request. Subsequently, access is granted specifically for the research that is described in the request - nothing else. Just because you can access a resource does not mean that you have authorization to do so. You must operate within sanctioned parameters regardless of what may be technically possible.</p>

<h3>2.5 Unacceptable Behavior</h3>
<p>The following are examples of unacceptable behavior that are subject to the penalties described in section 2.7:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using, or attempting to use resources without authorization</li>
	<li>Using, or attempting to use, supported commercial tools without authorization or for purposes other than those stated on your permission request</li>
	<li>Users should not assess others’ code for a fee</li>
	<li>Users may not assess others’ code for a malicious intent, e.g., to find bugs, flaws, and vulnerabilities in others’ code with an intention to exploit those issues</li>
	<li>Tampering with or obstructing the operation of the facilities</li>
	<li>Reading, changing, distributing, or copying others' data or software without authorization</li>
	<li>Using resources to attempt to gain unauthorized access to other sites</li>
	<li>Activities in violation of local, state, or federal law</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.6 Reporting Suspicious Activity</h3>
<p>You are responsible for immediately reporting exposed or compromised passwords, keys, passphrases, or certificates as well as suspicious activity on your account. Report all suspicious activity, whether or not you suspect an account or system has been compromised, to <code><a href="mailto:support@continuousassurance.org">support@continuousassurance.org</a></code>.</p>

<h3>2.7 Penalties</h3>
<p>Failure to abide by this agreement may result in a variety of penalties, including:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Temporary account suspension or permanent revocation without notice (including loss of access to data stored in the application) if there is suspicion of account or system compromise, malicious, or illegal activity.</li>
	<li>Loss of current access and the inability to obtain future access.</li>
	<li>Abusive activity may be reported to your home institution for administrative review and/or action.</li>
	<li>Civil litigation may be pursued to recoup costs incurred from unauthorized use of resources or incident response due to a system compromise or malicious activity.</li>
	<li>Criminal penalties could result from violations of federal, state, or local laws. Incidents may be reported to the appropriate authorities for investigation and/or prosecution.</li>
</ul>
