<p>When you link your account to an external identity provider, you are asking us to rely on the security of that provider. You are responsible for protecting your linked account with a <a style="cursor: pointer" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="right" title="Password Policy" data-content="<%= passwordPolicy %>">strong password</a>. We also recommend enabling two factor authentication with the linked identity provider account, if possible.</p>

<p>Note that signing out of the application does <b>not</b> sign you out of your external identity provider. For that you will either need to go to your external identity provider's home page and 'sign out' or clear your browser's cookies.</p>
